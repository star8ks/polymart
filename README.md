# Poly-Maker

Poly-Maker now runs as a **passive liquidity rewards engine** for Polymarket. Instead of chasing directional alpha, the process focuses on quoting inside each market's reward band to earn incentive payouts with minimal inventory churn. A summary of the original experience running the legacy trading version is available [here](https://x.com/defiance_cr/status/1906774862254800934).

## Overview

Poly-Maker is a focused solution for passive liquidity provision on Polymarket. It includes:

- Reward-band aware quoting that keeps resting orders inside the incentive window
- Real-time order book monitoring via WebSockets
- Position sizing derived from Google Sheets configuration
- Automated position merging functionality for on-chain efficiency

## Structure

The repository consists of several interconnected modules:

- `poly_data`: Core data management, reward-band quoting, and passive order maintenance
- `poly_merger`: Utility for merging positions (based on open-source Polymarket code)
- `poly_stats`: Account statistics tracking
- `poly_utils`: Shared utility functions, including Google Sheets helpers
- `data_updater`: Separate module for collecting market information and populating sheets

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 with latest setuptools
- Node.js (for `poly_merger`)
- Google Sheets API credentials
- Polymarket account and API credentials

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/star8ks/polymart.git
cd polymart
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/merijjeyn/logan.git
```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies for the merger**:
```
cd poly_merger
npm install
cd ..
```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

5. **Configure your credentials in `.env`**:
- `PK`: Your private key for Polymarket
- `BROWSER_ADDRESS`: Your wallet address

Make sure your wallet has done at least one trade thru the UI so that the permissions are proper.

6. **Set up Google Sheets integration**:
   -[Create a Google Service Account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) and download json credential file as credentials.json to the main directory
   - Enable Google Sheets API for the google cloud project at [this page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com)
   - Copy the [sample Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/read1yST71iAMQswCYTFfqKDDgPbDZLC7JWV7rwKIVu1OGnw/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Add your Google service account to the sheet with edit permissions
   - Update `SPREADSHEET_URL` in your `.env` file

7. **Update market data**:
   - Run `python update_markets.py` to fetch incentive information and refresh the Google Sheet tabs
   - Keep this running in the background (ideally on a different IP) so the sheet receives fresh reward-band metrics
   - Review the "All Markets" sheet for the raw feed and the "Selected Markets" sheet for the current trading universe
   - Tune liquidity limits and offsets in the "Hyperparameters" sheet if the defaults are not suitable

8. **Start the passive liquidity loop**:
```
python main.py
```
   The bot syncs with the sheet, calculates reward-band quotes, and maintains resting yes/no orders within the incentive window. There is no directional strategy module anymoreâ€”only passive quoting for rewards.

## Configuration

The bot is configured via a Google Spreadsheet with several worksheets:

- **All Markets**: Database of all markets on Polymarket (continuously refreshed by `update_markets.py`). Add a first-column header that normalizes to `Manual Select` (capitalisation/spacing ignored). Any non-empty cell in that column forces the corresponding market into the trading set, regardless of automated filters.
- **Selected Markets**: Output of the selection pipeline. Manually included rows are tagged with `selection_source = manual`, while the remaining slots are filled automatically based on reward and attractiveness. The sheet is overwritten on every `update_markets.py` run, so make manual picks on the "All Markets" tab instead of editing this sheet directly.
- **Hyperparameters**: Configuration parameters used by the reward-band quoting logic (spread offsets, minimum sizes, budget multipliers)

### Market Selection Modes

Poly-Maker supports two complementary selection paths:

- **Automatic selection** (default): `filter_selected_markets` applies reward, liquidity, and activity filters, then chooses the top `MARKET_COUNT` markets sorted by `gm_reward_per_100` and `attractiveness_score`.
- **Manual overrides**: Flag any row in "All Markets" with a non-empty `Manual Select` entry to guarantee inclusion. Those markets occupy the first slots, and the automatic picker fills the remaining capacity. This lets you pin high-conviction markets while still benefiting from dynamic filtering for the rest of the book.


## Poly Merger

The `poly_merger` module is a utility that handles position merging on Polymarket. It's built on open-source Polymarket code and provides a smooth way to consolidate positions, reducing gas fees and improving capital efficiency.

## Important Notes

- This code interacts with real markets and can potentially lose real money
- Test thoroughly with small amounts before deploying with significant capital
- The `data_updater` is technically a separate repository but is included here for convenience
